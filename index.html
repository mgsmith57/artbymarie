    After few years at home her father finally relented and allowed her to study
    nursing. She graduated in 1964 from the Faculté Française de Medicine nursing
    school in Beirut and immediately was recruited by the main French university
    hospital in Beirut, Hôtel Dieu de France.

    In the summer of 1974 Marie resigned from Hôtel Dieu to marry Terry Smith,
    a geophysicist working at that time in Jakarta. Terry and Marie met in 1972
    and had dated for a year in Beirut prior to his transfer to Indonesia. Marie
    travelled to Jakarta to be married in October 1974. Their son Marc was born
    at Hotel Dieu de France, Beirut in August 1975.

    The family returned to England in September 1975 and after ten months the Smith
    trio moved in June 1976 to Terry’s new assignment in Cairo. April 1978 finds
    them in Madrid and January 1981 in Tunisia. The Netherlands became their home
    from November 1984 until May1989 when they returned to England and settled in
    Bedford.

    Finding herself with time on her hands Marie embarked on variety of learning
    courses: - counselling in Hackney, neuro linguistic programming at St Ann's
    Hospital, reflexology at the Baily School in London, body massage, carpentry,
    interior design and painting & decorating at Bedford College.

  <div class="section">
    Running out of ideas on what to do next, a kind neighbour suggested watercolour
    painting. The suggestion led Marie stumbling into the art world.
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    Marie above all else, is a loving wife and mother to her husband Terry and only
    child Marc. After that she is a student of life, with an insatiable appetite for
    learning brought about by her gregarious outgoing personality, a lifetime of
    nurturing the two men in her life, travelling, and her voracious reading.
