    As for her oil painting, like the rest, it all started with a chance remark.
  </div>

  <div class="section">

    to try and reproduce a painting for him.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    She decided against taking oil painting lessons to learn the basics of the
    medium, and instead plunged ahead, prepared to ruin a couple of canvases in
    the process.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
